The issue of redistribution of the vibrational-rotational energy of polyatomic molecules M and $M_1$ in their pairwise collisions based on microcanonical distribution is taken into consideration in relation to the chaotic dynamics of the transient state in molecular and physicochemical transitions in quantum-classical mechanics. When the semiclassical approximation for the density of vibrational-rotational states is applicable, the statistical (canonical) distribution of the probability of energy change due to collisions in the case of a small impurity M in an equilibrium medium of $M_1$ is obtained, along with all of its moments n, which are some polynomials of the nth order.
